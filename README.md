### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marat

For the last year I've been studying Data Science with all related fields, such as:
* python with all necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn etc.)
* sql
* statistics
* mathematics
* ML algorithms, including deep learning using pytorch
* other tech stack used in DS (Superset, Redash, Airflow, ClickHouse)

I finished number of courses on these topics, including:
* 'Applied Data Science with Python' Coursera specialization provided by University of Michigan;
* 'Data Analyst School' Professional Certificate provided by Sberbank Corporate University;
* 'Data Analyst Simulator' provided by Karpov Courses;
* 'Deep Learning School' provided by MIPT.

[All of my study progress with finishing certificates and learned skills might be seen here](https://www.notion.so/marat-study/16760cfff75841cc8dd19b98cf690745?v=b69068d654e74ec88d479dfa36a364a5)

Currently I'm open for any project collaboration and job suggestions, including internship.
